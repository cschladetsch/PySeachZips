- [ ] **Scheduled operations**: Cron-like scheduling for regular scans and cleanups
- [ ] **Event-driven processing**: Monitor directories for new ZIP files
- [ ] **Rule-based extraction**: Automatic extraction based on configurable rules

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] **Access logging**: Track who accessed what files and when
- [ ] **Password-protected ZIP support**: Handle encrypted ZIP archives
- [ ] **File integrity verification**: Checksums and hash validation
- [ ] **Audit trails**: Complete history of all operations performed

### User Interface Improvements
- [ ] **Interactive shell mode**: REPL-style interface for multiple operations
- [ ] **Progress visualization**: Better progress bars with estimated completion times
- [ ] **Colorized output customization**: User-configurable color schemes
- [ ] **Accessibility improvements**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

## Technical Debt & Code Quality
